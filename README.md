# Symmetry454

This is a calendar app that uses the [Symmetry454](https://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/symmetry.htm)
calendar instead of the usual Gregorian calendar.

For now, it can show you a functioning Symmetry454 calendar, navigate between dates,
and even show equivalent Symmetry454 dates for a given Gregorian date.

While not yet implemented, in the future, this app is planned to have:

* Event management such as birthdays and holidays
* A variant implementattion of the [Swatch Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) 
* Alarms, countdown timers, et cetera
